we are going to create node js rest api and mongodb

to initiate nodejs application
npm init -y (npm init -y. will simply generate an empty npm project without going through an interactive process. The -y stands for yes )
npm i express mongoose dotenv nodemon
(dotenv secure data)

to start application once - node index.js
for continuous running of node application - nodemon index.js
we can change in scripts in package.json :
start:"nodemon index.js"
thereafter just use npm start

mongodb atlas-yashjaiswalecommerce(same password)
'mongodb+srv://yashjaiswalecommerce:yashjaiswalecommerce@ecommerce.iwsissk.mongodb.net/shop?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
can connect through vscode also

we can save our hardcoded variables in .env file which can be access by dotenv

first we need to define all the schemas under model
then make routes for all api end points
we are using cyptoJS for encrypting passwords-npm i crypto-js

add more security - npm i jsonwebtoken
provide user a web token on login


after setting our rest api(Representational state transfer -an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet)

we will add a payment method that's stripe
get the secret key and add it in .env
npm install stripe --save

---------------------------------------
we need to add return after every response to stop further execution - without it we are giving multiple response to single call on wrong password
